# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is currently not compatible with SWC. See [this issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/issues/428) for tracking the progress.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

SIBATHON 2026: AI in business - AI Marketing ROI Predictor


Problem Statement
Small and medium businesses often invest in multiple marketing campaigns without knowing which ones will yield the best results. This leads to wasted budgets, missed opportunities, and difficulty in making data-driven decisions. There is a need for a system that can analyze past marketing performance and provide actionable predictions for future campaigns, helping businesses optimize their marketing investments.
Proposed Solution
The AI Marketing ROI Predictor is an intelligent tool designed to assist businesses in making smarter, data-driven marketing decisions. By analyzing historical campaign data, the system predicts the potential outcomes of future campaigns and provides recommendations to maximize return on investment (ROI) while minimizing wasted spending.
Key Features
•	Upload historical marketing campaign data in CSV format (campaign name, amount spent, sales generated, platform).
•	AI predicts expected performance of future campaigns.
•	Provides actionable recommendations:
o	Identify campaigns with high potential ROI for increased investment.
o	Highlight campaigns likely to underperform to reduce or avoid spending.
•	Optional visualization of campaign performance trends.
•	Human-readable insights for non-technical users.
Technologies Used
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS; optional use of React for interactive dashboards
•	Backend: Python with Flask or FastAPI
•	AI/ML: scikit-learn for regression or classification models
•	Data Handling: CSV input for campaign data; sample data used for demonstration purposes
